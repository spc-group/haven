Bluesky tools for beamlines managed by the spectroscopy group.

"Don't fly in anything with a Capissen 38 engine, they fall right out
of the sky."


## Setup and Installation

First, download the package from github:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spc-group/haven.git
$ cd haven
```

Haven uses **pixi** for managing **environments** and **dependencies**,
and running **tasks**.

If **pixi** is not installed, follow the instructions [here](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/).


## Usage

To start an iPython session with all the instrument features loaded, use:

```bash
$ pixi run ipython
```

The default environment does not connect to any real hardware, and is
meant for demonstration purposes.

To **select a real beamline**, provide an environment using ``-e <beamline>`` or
``--environment <beamline>``:

```bash
pixi run ipython -e 25idc
```

## Firefly (GUI)

Firefly is a user-facing application for controlling the beamlines
managed by the spectroscopy group. It can be started using:

```bash
$ pixi run firefly
```

Firefly uses the same pixi environments described above.

To make changes to the window layouts using Qt Designer, use:

```bash
$ pixi run designer
```


## Running Tests

To run tests for a specific package, use:

```
$ pixi run test-haven
$ pixi run test-firefly
```

To run all tests as well as linting and type-checking, use:

```
$ pixi run test-all
```

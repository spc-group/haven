    """Collect a spectrum by scanning X-ray energy.

    For scanning over a pre-defined X-ray absorption edge, try
    :py:func:`~haven.plans.xafs_scan.xafs_scan` instead.

    *exposure* can be either a float, or a sequence of floats. If a
    single value is provided, it will be used for all energies. If a
    sequence is provided, it should be the same length as *energies*
    and the each entry will be used for the corresponding entry in
    *energies*.

    The calculated exposure times will be set for every signal in
    *time_signals*. If *time_signals* is ``None``, then
    *time_signals* will be determined automatically from
    *detectors*: for each detector, if it has an attribute/property
    *default_time_signal*, then this signal will be included in
    *time_signals*.

    **Usage:**

    The following code will run a scan with 1 eV steps from 13000 to
    13099 eV.

        energies = range(13000, 13100)
        RE(energy_scan(energies, exposure=0.5))

    The preparation of energies is up to the calling function. For
    more sophisticated energy lists, consider using the utility
    functions :py:class:`haven.energy_ranges.ERange` and
    :py:class:`haven.energy_ranges.KRange`:

    .. code-block:: python

        energies = [
          ERange(13000, 13100, E_step=10),
          ERange(13100, 13160, E_step=0.5),
          KRange(13160, k_max=8, k_step=0.2),
        ]
        RE(energy_scan(energies, exposure=0.5))

    The results can also be viewed by passing
    :py:class:`haven.callbacks.live_xafs_plot.LiveXAFSPlot` to the RunEngine:

    .. code-block:: python

        RE(energy_scan(...), LiveXAFSPlot())

    Parameters
    ==========
    energies
      The X-ray energies, in eV, over which to scan.
    exposure
      How long, in seconds, to count at each energy.
    E0
      An edge energy, in eV, or name of the edge of the form
      ``"Ni_L3"``. All energies will be relative to this value.
    detectors
      The detectors to collect X-ray signal from at each energy.
    energy_signals
      Positioners that will receive the changing energies.
    time_signals
      Positioners that will receive the exposure time for each scan.
    md
      Additional metadata to pass on the to run engine.

    Yields
    ======
    Bluesky messages to execute the scan.

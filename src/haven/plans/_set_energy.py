    Moves both the mono energy, and the undulator energy with a
    calibrated offset.

    The *harmonic* parameter selects a harmonic for the undulator. If
    ``"auto"``, then the harmonic will be selected based on the
    energy. If *harmonic* is ``None``, then the current harmonic is
    used. If *harmonic* is an integer (e.g. 1, 3, 5) then this value
    will be used.

    The *undulator_offset* parameter sets the offset applied to any
    undulators. If ``"auto"``, then the offset will be selected from a
    calibration look-up table. If ``None``, then offset will not be
    changed. Otherwise, *id_offset* will be set directly.

    Parameters
    ==========
    energy
      The target energy of the beamline, in electron-volts.
    harmonic
      Which harmonic to use for the undulator. Can be an integer
      (e.g. 1, 3, 5), ``None``, or ``"auto"``.
    undulator_offset
      Offset to apply for the undulators. Can be a float, ``None``, or
      ``"auto"``.

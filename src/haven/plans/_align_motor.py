    Find and set the position of maximum intensity in the ion chamber

    Parameters
    ==========
    pitch2
      The pitch2 motor to use
    bec
      A bluesky best effort callback for finding the peak position.
    distance
      Relative distance to scan in either direction.
    reverse
      Whether the scan goes low-to-high (False) or high-to-low (True).
    detector
      Which detector name to use.
    feature
      Which feature of the peak to use for alignment.
    md
      Extra metadata to pass into the run engine.

    the *inverse* and *forward* transforms.

    The default behavior will forward the set value to the real
    signals, and read the real signal's value back (or average of the
    signals if multiple are given).

    arguments when creating this backend, or subclass this backend and
    override the ``forward()`` and ``inverse()`` methods.

    *forward()* should be an async function that accepts a positional
    argument with the value sent to this derived signal, along with
    keyword-only arguments corresponding to the signals indicated in
    *derived_from*. It should return a mapping of real signals

    of real signals to their read value, along with

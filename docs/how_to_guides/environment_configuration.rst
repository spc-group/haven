Environment & Configuration
===========================

This how-to guide covers configuring a python environment to run
Haven, Firefly, and the Haven Queueserver.

Environmental Variables
-----------------------

To properly configure an environment for running Haven, Firefly, and
the Queueserver, configure the following environmental variables.

``HAVEN_CONFIG_DIR``
  Path to the folder holding local configuration. This will also be used
  for files automatically generated by e.g. the
  Queueserver. E.g. ``~/bluesky``.
``QSERVER_ZMQ_CONTROL_ADDRESS``
  The ZeroMQ host and port to be used for clients to connect to the
  queueserver. E.g. ``tcp://hostname.anl.gov:60615``
``QSERVER_ZMQ_CONTROL_ADDRESS_FOR_SERVER``
  The ZeroMQ host and port to be used by the queueserver
  itself. E.g. ``tcp://*:60615``
``QSERVER_ZMQ_INFO_ADDRESS``
  The ZeroMQ host and port to be used for clients to connect to the
  queueserver. E.g. ``tcp://hostname.anl.gov:60615``
``QSERVER_ZMQ_INFO_ADDRESS_FOR_SERVER``
  The ZeroMQ host and port to be used by the queueserver
  itself. E.g. ``tcp://*:60625``
